# DevOps-AWS
## Based on AWS trainning 

### Day 1 –

```Our engineers will work with everyone to ensure they have their AWS account setup, and we will provide you credit vouchers to apply to your own AWS account. We’ll look at the AWS services that we’ll be using over the next few nights, and discuss application and infrastructure architectures and best practices. We’ll then dive into the tech and get hands-on with some of these services to get our CI/CD pipelines up and running. By 7.30 pm we aim to start food and drinks and hope to see everyone meet our fellow support engineers at AWS.```

### Day 2 – 

```We’ll dive into the container architecture running our application, and look at how to handle updates, monitoring and scaling. There will be more food and beer, along with the opportunity to talk some more and have any questions answered.```

 

### Day 3 –

```We give you a challenge and see what you have learned, to get your chance to work here at AWS. Do well here and you will be fast tracked to our last round of interviews!```
